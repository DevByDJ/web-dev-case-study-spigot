## Getting Started

Once you've downloaded the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`),

create a .env and add the following variable:
```.emv
VITE_API_KEY={Value of the API KEY}
```
Click Save.

Next, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
